# CodeCademyTeaCozy

This is my second project I've completed with no tutorial, just based off of a design spec by CodeCademy.

Here is the design spec. https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg

The hardest part was aligning the flex containers, which has been my biggest learning challenge yet. 

I love working on my laptop at coffee shops. With this homepage, I would definetly be a patron of Tea Cozy.
